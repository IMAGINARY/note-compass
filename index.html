<h2>Modes of the major scale</h2>
<p>Let us assume that our tuning is fixed, and we have 12 notes per octave equally distributed (12-TET). We can call them note-0, note-1, ..., and note-11. The note-12 is one octave up than note-0. 

<p>With this point of view, a "scale" is just a selection of some of these 12 notes, the ones that we are using more in our songs. To describe a scale, it suffices to give the interval code and the starting note. For instance, the most important scale in Western music is the C-Major, which has the code
2 2 1 2 2 2 1
and starts in note-0 which is called C (or Do).

<p>The notes on the Major scale are note-0, note-2, note-4, note-5, note-7, note-9, note-11. Historically, they receive the names C, D, E, F, G, A, B. The rest of the notes are not on this scale, and they receive relative names, subordinated to the names of the notes of the Major scale (such as C# or Db).
